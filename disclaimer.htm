<h2>Lemmini</h2>

<br>

This is the first time you start Lemmini, so please read the text below
carefully.<br>

<br>

Lemmini&nbsp;is a platform independent&nbsp;engine for the game
Lemmings. The original game was developed by DMA Design back in 1990
and released by Psygnosis in 1991. All the rights for the game
"Lemmings" are now owned by Sony (as far as I know).<br>

Lemmini&nbsp;does not include the resources necessary to actually
play
the game. You need a legal copy of "Lemmings for Windows" to be able to
play&nbsp;Lemmini.<br>

When starting&nbsp;Lemmini for the first time&nbsp;or
when updating to a new version with different resources you will be
prompted to select your "WINLEMM"&nbsp;path and a destination path
that the
resources will be extracted to. You don't actually need to install
Lemmings for Windows, it's enough if you enter the original CD-ROM.<br>

While
this is a bit of a hassle,&nbsp;this step is necessary to not
infringe the
rights of the copyright holders.<br>

Lemmini&nbsp;itself (the game engine) is free for all to use.
Download it, give it
to your friends or whatever. If you intend to put it as download on
your site, please make a reference to the original homepage. Anyway, to
respect the rights of the original copyright holders, I explicitly
forbid to distribute&nbsp;Lemmini with the "Lemmings for Windows"
resources in any form. If you still intend to do so, please contact the
copyright holders.<br>For more details please visit <a href="http://lemmini.de">http://lemmini.de</a>.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lemmini&nbsp;is
provided "as is"
without warranty of any kind. Use it at your own risk.</span><br>
