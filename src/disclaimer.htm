<h2>SuperLemminiToo</h2>

<p>Thank you for choosing SuperLemminiToo to play the classic games <i>Lemmings™</i>, <i>Oh No! More Lemmings™</i>, and <i>Holiday Lemmings™</i>.</p>
<p>
This message appears the first time you start SuperLemminiToo, so please read the text below carefully:

</p>

<p>SuperLemminiToo only exists because of the hard work done by those who came before:<br>
Lemmini: <a href="http://lemmini.de">http://lemmini.de</a> and,<br>
SuperLemmini: <a href="https://www.lemmingsforums.net/index.php?topic=1793.0">https://www.lemmingsforums.net/index.php?topic=1793.0</a>.

<p>SuperLemminiToo, like its predecessors, is a platform-independent Java-based engine for the game Lemmings. The original game was developed by DMA Design back in 1990 and released by Psygnosis in 1991. All the rights for the game "Lemmings" are now owned by Sony (as far as I know). DMA Design is now known as Rockstar North Limited, and is best know for the Grand Theft Auto series.  Yes, that's right... Lemmings is the grand-daddy to Grant Theft Auto.</p>

<p>The resources included with SuperLemminiToo are slightly-modified from those originally part of the "<i>Lemmings for Windows</i>" release 1995 and 1996 (with Lemmings Paintball). Because of this, you need a legal copy of "<i>Lemmings for Windows</i>" to be able to legally play SuperLemminiToo.</p>

<p>Also included are levels from several shareware versions of Lemmings™, and custom-made sprites from several people I don't know. (If you made the hi-res xmas lemming sprites, or xmas lemming icons, let me know.)</p>

<p>SuperLemminiToo (the game engine) is free for all to use. Download it, give it to your friends or whatever. If you intend to put it as a download on your site, please make a reference to the original homepage.</p>
