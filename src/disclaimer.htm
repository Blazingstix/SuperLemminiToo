<h2>SuperLemmini</h2>

<br>

This is the first time you start SuperLemmini, so please read the text below carefully.<br>

<br>

<p>SuperLemmini is a platform-independent engine for the game Lemmings. The original game was developed by DMA Design back in 1990 and released by Psygnosis in 1991. All the rights for the game "Lemmings" are now owned by Sony (as far as I know).</p>

<p>SuperLemmini does not include the resources necessary to actually play the game. You need a legal copy of "Lemmings for Windows" to be able to play SuperLemmini.</p>

<p>When starting SuperLemmini for the first time or when updating to a new version with different resources, you will be prompted to select your "WINLEMM" path and a destination path that the resources will be extracted to. You don't actually need to install Lemmings for Windows; it's enough if you enter the original CD-ROM.</p>

<p>While this is a bit of a hassle, this step is necessary to not infringe the rights of the copyright holders.</p>

<p>SuperLemmini itself (the game engine) is free for all to use. Download it, give it to your friends or whatever. If you intend to put it as a download on your site, please make a reference to the original homepage. To respect the rights of the original copyright holders, the author of the original Lemmini, Volker Oth, explicitly forbids the distribution of Lemmini or SuperLemmini with the "Lemmings for Windows" resources in any form. If you intend to do so, please contact the copyright holders.</p>
