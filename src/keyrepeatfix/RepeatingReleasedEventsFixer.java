/**
 * This {@link AWTEventListener} tries to work around <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4153069">a 12 yo
 * bug</a> in the Linux KeyEvent handling for keyboard repeat. Linux apparently implements repeating keypresses by
 * repeating both the {@link KeyEvent#KEY_PRESSED} <b>and</b> {@link KeyEvent#KEY_RELEASED}, while on Windows, one only
 * gets repeating PRESSES, and then a final RELEASE when the key is released. The Windows way is obviously much more
 * useful, as one then can easily distinguish between a user holding a key pressed, and a user hammering away on the
 * key.
 *
 * This class is an {@link AWTEventListener} that should be installed as the application's first ever
 * {@link AWTEventListener} using the following code, but it is simpler to invoke {@link #install() install(new
 * instance)}:
 *
 * <br>
 * <pre> * Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().addAWTEventListener(new {@link RepeatingReleasedEventsFixer}, AWTEvent.KEY_EVENT_MASK);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Remember to remove it and any other installed {@link AWTEventListener} if your application have some "reboot"
 * functionality that can potentially install it again - or else you'll end up with multiple instances, which isn't too
 * hot.
 *
 * <b>Notice:</b> Read up on the {@link Reposted} interface if you have other AWTEventListeners that resends KeyEvents
 * (as this one does) - or else we'll get the event back.
 * <br>
 * <h3>
 * Mode of operation</h3>
 * The class makes use of the fact that the subsequent PRESSED event comes right after the RELEASED event - one thus
 * have a sequence like this:
 *
 * <pre> * PRESSED
 * -wait between key repeats-
 * RELEASED
 * PRESSED
 * -wait between key repeats-
 * RELEASED
 * PRESSED
 * etc.
 * </pre>
 *
 * A timer is started when receiving a RELEASED event, and if a PRESSED comes soon afterwards, the RELEASED is dropped
 * (consumed) - while if the timer times out, the event is reposted and thus becomes the final, wanted RELEASED that
 * denotes that the key actually was released.
 *
