/**

 * - if a key is pressed and released, a single SINGLE_CLICK is returned
 * - if a key is pressed for longer than timeFirstPress but not released,
 *   a SINGLE_CLICK event is returned. Then if the key is still not released,
 *   each timeRepeat nanoseconds, a new SINGLE_CLICK is returned.
 * - if a key is pressed, released and pressed again within timeDoubleClick
 *   nanoseconds, a DOUBLE_CLICK is fired.
